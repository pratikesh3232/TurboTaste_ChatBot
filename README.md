# TurboTaste Order Chatbot Backend

**TurboTaste** Order Bot is the backend logic for a Dialogflow-powered virtual assistant that helps users place, modify, track, and cancel fast food orders in real-time. The bot uses a FastAPI application that connects to your fast food business database.

## 🚀 Features

- Add, remove, or cancel items in an order
- Track order status via order ID
- Complete orders and store them in the database
- Session-based order management
- Rich responses compatible with Dialogflow Messenger
- Extensible and modular code structure

4. **Run the FastAPI app**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

5. **Link to Dialogflow Webhook**
    - In Dialogflow Console, use your running endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/` or your deployed URL) as the webhook for fulfillment.
